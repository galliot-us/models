# Neuralet #

Neuralet is an open-source platform for edge deep learning models on GPU, TPU, and more. We hope to make it easier to start and evaluate various deep learning models on different edge devices.

We currently provide models for [Coral Dev Board](https://coral.ai/products/dev-board/) and soon will release models for other edge devices such as [NVIDIA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) and more.

### How to use Neuralet? ###

Neuralet is a set of docker containers that are packaged to run directly on the device. A separate docker container is built for each model on each device to make it very simple to get started with any model on any device.

For documentation and more details view [Neuralet's main github repo](https://github.com/neuralet/neuralet).
